# ![JavaScript](http://www.xappsoftware.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/javascript_logo.png) Learning JavaScript
This is simple group of lessons designed specifically to focus on the things you need to know to get your feet wet with JavaScript.  The goal is not to dive into the arcane pedantic details of the language, but provide a sound grounding in concepts and code practices which are frequently used in the environment of web development -- particularly in the context of writing JavaScript within a front-end framework.

These lessons assume basic familiarity with essential programming concepts such as:
- Declaring and assigning values to variables.
- Basic function declarations.
- Simple arithmetic operations (+, -, /, *,... maybe %?)
- Order of operation precedence concerning above operators.
- Flow control (e.g. if-else statements).

Below you will find the basic progression of the curriculum.  Feel free to jump around instead of following in a linear fashion.  My philosophy on learning is that you won't necessarily understand everything the first time through.  What is important is that you remember what you don't understand.  That way, when it does click (and it will eventually) you're going to be able to make sense of that weird code you once saw but didn't know how to interpret.  One word of caution, however: jumping too far ahead may assume (with no warning) that you have completed and understand topics which were covered in a previous exercise.  If you find yourself completely lost, you may want to refer back to lessons you might have skipped over.
